    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>
        Hi! My name is Julian, and I'm a Mechanical Engineering Honors student at UT Austin.
        I've been focusing on thermal-fluid systems, structural mechanics, and integrated system design.
        My main projects combine first principles and engineering analysis from Heat Transfer,
        Materials, Fluid Mechanics, and Mechanics of Solids.
    </p>

    <p>
        The application of these fundamentals spans structural buckling, fatigue analysis,
        convective heat transfer optimization, and closed-loop control systems.
    </p>

    <p>
        My internship at the Center for Electromechanics, leadership role in Longhorn Baja Racing,
        and active membership in Texas Marine Robotics have given me exposure to end-to-end
        mechanical design projects with real constraints, budgets, and performance consequences.
    </p>

    <p>
        I am particularly interested in problems where fluid mechanics, heat transfer,
        and structural mechanics intersect with practical product implementation.
    </p>
