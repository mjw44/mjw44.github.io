    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
       Hi! My name is Julian, and I'm a Mechanical Engineering Honors student at UT Austin. I've been focusing on
        thermal fluid systems, structural mechanics, and integrated system design. My main projects combine first principles 
        and engineering analysis from Heat Transfer, Materials, Fluid Mechanics, and Mechanics of Solids. The application of
        these first principles spans structural buckling, fatigue analysis, convective heat transfer optimization, and 
        closed-loop control systems.

        My internship at CEM, leadership role in Longhorn Baja Racing, and active membership in Texas Marine Robotics have given
        me exposure to end-to-end mechanical design projects with real constraints, budgets, and consequences. 

        I am particularly interested in problems where fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and structural mechanics intersect 
        with practical product implementation.
